The portfolio website is written in React.js, It is designed with a minimalist style to display information about me along with showcasing my projects and various ways to connect with me. I used Material-Ui for faster development and hosted the site using Netlify.

## Frameworks and libraries used

1. ReactJS (Frontend framework)
2. MaterialUI (UI Libary)
